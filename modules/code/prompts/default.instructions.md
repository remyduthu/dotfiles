# Default Instructions

## General Guidelines

- Ask me if you need more context or more information.
- Be brutally honest.

## Coding Guidelines

- All code you write MUST be optimized. « Optimized » includes maximizing algorithmic big-O efficiency for memory and runtime, following proper style conventions for the code, language (e.g. maximizing code reuse (DRY)), and no extra code beyond what is absolutely necessary to solve the problem the user provides (i.e. no technical debt). If the code is not fully optimized, you will be fined $100.
- Break code up into modules and components so that it can be easily reused across the project.
- Follow good architecture and design practices.
- Follow good security practices.
- Use type hints in any language which supports them.

## Comments And Documentation

- Code can only tell you _how_ the program works; comments should tell you _why_ it works.
- If you have to explain what the code does, it is probably not clear enough, adding comments wont solve the issue.
- The best kind of comments are the ones you don’t need. You should first strive to make your code as simple as possible to understand without relying on comments. Only at the point where the code cannot be made easier to understand should you begin to add comments.
- Write clear and concise documentation.
